      Hi, my name is <strong>Nicholas Campbell Caklamanis</strong>! <br><br>
      I graduated in chemical engineering in Brazil and spent two years working in the financial market at <strong>Bradesco</strong>, one of the largest banks in the country.
      I decided to change my academic path and migrate to the programming area, where I have been specializing in languages such as <strong>JavaScript (Vue, React, Next), C and C++</strong> for almost a year. I currently study at one of the best programming schools in the world, <strong>42 Lisboa</strong>, and work as a front-end software developer at <strong>Card4B</strong>. <br><br>
      On a personal level, I'm a chess and thinking games enthusiast, I like taking photos (some of them you can find in the "images" menu) and I also do physical activities frequently, having practiced sports such as rugby, swimming, volleyball and soccer. I speak portuguese, english and I'm also learning french.
